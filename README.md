# Schedule-Assistant (WIP)
Your assistant to all scheduling problems you have while choosing Computer Science classes for each semester.

## About the Project
An innovative solution to the constant hurdle of students waiting weeks on end for advisor appointments to begin thinking about a schedule for the next semester. Schedule Assistant is designed to help students format their upcoming schedules without needing help from professors. 
  I am currently working on this website throughout this semester, and into the summer, as I want to fix some user-interface bugs. For example, you have to enter all the courses you take at once, the courses are not checked for extra whitespace, etc. I would also like to add a database for the back-end and a user portal for people to see their progress within their major. 


### Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

  ## Updates

During my Human Computer Interaction class, I learned that the interface being easy to use is an important aspect of the design of the website. Thinking about this project, I realized that having users enter in each task they have taken was time-consuming and unnecessary. Therefore, I updated the interface to allow users to simply select the courses they've taken.
