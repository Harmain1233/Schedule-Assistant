# Schedule-Assistant (WIP)
Your assistant to all scheduling problems you have while choosing Computer Science classes for each semester.

## About the Project
An innovative solution to the constant hurdle of students waiting weeks on end for advisor appointments to begin thinking about a schedule for the next semester. Schedule Assistant is designed to help students format their upcoming schedules without needing help from professors. 

### Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**

## Work In Progress
      I am currently working on this website throughout this semester, and into the summer, as I want to fix some user-interface bugs. For example, you have to enter all the courses you take at once, the courses are not checked for extra whitespace, etc. I would also like to add a database for the back-end and a user portal for people to see their progress within their major.
